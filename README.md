# NaRuTo - Natural Rule Tool

## Overview

NaRuTo is an enhanced fork of the Natural Rule Language (NRL) Parser, designed to provide extended capabilities and improved functionality for working with natural language-like constraints over models.

## Features

### Extended Grammar Support

NaRuTo extends the grammar-driven parser to support a wider range of expressions and constructs. It empowers you to create complex rules that capture intricate relationships within your models.

### Custom Mapping Engines

While the NRL originally provided support for Java mapping programs, NaRuTo expands this capability to various programming languages and platforms. Create mapping programs in your preferred language, whether it's Python, JavaScript, or any other language, and execute them against corresponding objects or data structures.

### Seamless Integration with CLiX and XML

NaRuTo enhances the integration with CLiX and XML platforms. You can now write rules that directly manipulate XML data, opening up new possibilities for data transformation and manipulation.

### Enhanced API and Documentation

The NaRuTo package comes with an updated and comprehensive API, accompanied by detailed documentation.
