-- Test whether "existence statement" references without model elements

Model "unused"

-- In this rule, the second "and one has" refers to 'elements',
-- which is introduced in the first quantifier
Context: Test
Validation Rule "valid-reference"
one of the test elements has foo = 'A' and one has foo = 'B'

-- This is also legal. Again, "one" refers to "elements"
Context: Test
Validation Rule "valid-reference-2"
if one of the test elements has foo = 'A' then one has bar = 'B'

-- This is illegal. It's not clear what "one" refers to
Context: Test
Validation Rule "invalid-reference"
one has foo = 'B' and one of the test elements has foo = 'A'
