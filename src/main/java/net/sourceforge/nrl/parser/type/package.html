	Abstract type assignment and type checking for the completed AST. The classes in 
	this package work with the <code>ast</code> package to assign data types once the
	AST is loaded and has model information associated with it.
	<p>
	The <code>TypeChecker</code> class performs as a recursive visitor that assigns
	types from the bottom up. It makes use of an <code>ITypeMapping</code> to map 
	model elements to primitive types where necessary.
