<body>
    The fully resolved extended abstract syntax tree (AST) representation for the
    action language. The interfaces in this package extend those in the 
    <code>net.sourceforge.nrl.parser.ast.constraints</code> package and
    specify what a fully resolved representation of a rule file looks
	like.
	<p>
	The package specifies <b>no implementation</b>. In order to obtain an AST instance, use
	a concrete implementation, for example using the public classes in the impl package.
